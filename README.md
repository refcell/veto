### Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Document the install path for `veto` once the crate is published or binaries are distributed.

```sh
# Placeholder command — update once release artifacts exist.
cargo install veto
```

### Docker

_Explain the container strategy for Veto — image source, multi-stage usage, and local build process._

#### Using the Docker Image

```dockerfile
# Replace `your-org` and the binary path once finalized.
FROM ghcr.io/your-org/veto-builder:latest AS veto

FROM debian:bookworm-slim
COPY --from=veto /veto /usr/local/bin/veto
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/veto"]
```

#### Building Locally

```sh
just docker-build
```

_Add context about prerequisites, caching, or additional targets as the project evolves._

### What are Evaluations?

_Carry over the narrative from `ploit`, tailoring the evaluation story to Veto’s objectives. Reference any research, benchmarks, or motivating trends you plan to support._

### Usage

```
# Outline the CLI or service interface once it is implemented.
Usage: veto [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>
```

_Summarize expected subcommands, configuration files, and example workflows once they exist._

### Why?

_Capture the motivation for building Veto. Reuse and adapt themes from the ploit README so readers understand the problem space and Veto’s unique positioning._

### Contributing

_Document contribution guidelines, preferred tooling, and how to get support once the repository opens up for collaborators._
